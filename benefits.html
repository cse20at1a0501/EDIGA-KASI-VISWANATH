        <p>COSTS <br> We have all seen the organic apples in our local grocery store that are sometimes over twice as expensive as regular apples. The same goes for all other produce that is organically available. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>SHELF LIFE<br>The shelf life of organically produced crops is often much shorter compared to regular produce. This is because conventional produce is treated with waxes and preservatives to maintain its freshness during the shipping of the products. Sometimes also cling film is used to extend the shelf life of your fruits and veggies even further. Organic food does not receive these treatments and therefore spoil faster. This has another downside that part of (or even the entire) shipment of an organic crop might be lost if the crop was delayed or mistreated during transport. In this case, everything the farmer has produced might never reach the consumer. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>FARMING SYSTEMS<br> Because pests and diseases are controlled in a less hard manner, the crop is much more susceptible to crop loss due to these circumstances. When a part of the farmer's crop is lost, he has to increase the prices of his/her produce to ensure the continuation of his/her business.</p>
